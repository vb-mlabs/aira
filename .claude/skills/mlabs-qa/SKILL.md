  Scenario-driven QA testing. Asks the user what to focus on (a feature, a
  user journey, a suspected bug, or "everything"), drives Playwright through
  the relevant flows, captures screenshots and console errors, and writes a
  structured bug report to .mstack/qa/YYYY-MM-DD/. After user approval of the
  fix plan, applies fixes and re-verifies. May edit code, but only after an
  explicit approval gate.
  Use when the user says "qa this", "test the X flow", "find bugs in Y",
  "qa the app", or invokes /mlabs-qa.

# mlabs-qa

Scenario-driven QA: ask focus → test → report → approve → fix → re-verify.

## Phase 1 — Ask focus

Use AskUserQuestion to determine scope. Offer common scenarios:

- A specific feature (e.g. "auth", "messages", "admin")
- A specific user journey (e.g. "signup → email verify → first login")
- A suspected bug (e.g. "unread badge stays after opening message")
- The whole app smoke pass

Also ask: which env (`localhost:3000`, staging URL)? If localhost, verify the
dev server is up via `curl -sf http://localhost:3000 >/dev/null` — start it
with `npm run dev` only if the user confirms.

## Phase 2 — Test

1. **Initialise the QA directory:** `.mstack/qa/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>/` with
   `report.md` (scaffold below) and `assets/`.

2. **Drive Playwright** using the repo's existing config (`playwright.config.ts`,
   `e2e/`). Prefer writing temporary spec files in `.mstack/qa/<run>/specs/`
   rather than polluting `e2e/`. Run via `npx playwright test --reporter=list`
   pointed at the temporary spec dir.

3. **For each scenario step**, capture:
   - Screenshot to `assets/<step-N>.png`
   - Console errors and network failures (Playwright collects these)
   - Any visual regression (compare to last QA run if assets exist)

4. **Track tasks live** with TaskCreate per scenario step so the user sees
   progress.

5. **Categorise findings** by severity:
   - **critical** — auth broken, data loss, blank screens, crashes
   - **high** — flow can't complete, key feature broken
   - **medium** — UX friction, edge case mishandled, console errors
   - **low** — cosmetic, copy, minor polish

## Phase 3 — Report + approval gate

Write `report.md` with the scaffold below. Then use AskUserQuestion to ask:
"Found N issues (X critical, Y high, …). Approve the fix plan?" Options:

- **Approve all** — fix everything in the report
- **Approve subset** — user picks which severities or specific issues
- **Decline** — stop, leave the report for human follow-up

If declined, exit cleanly with status `report-only`.

## Phase 4 — Fix + re-verify (only if approved)

For each approved issue:

1. TaskUpdate `in_progress`.
2. Make the fix. Honour MLabs hard rules from `AGENTS.md` (no raw `process.env`,
   `import "server-only"`, Zod boundaries, Drizzle generate-not-push).
3. Run typecheck if `.ts`/`.tsx` was touched.
4. Re-run the failing scenario via Playwright. If it now passes, mark fixed.
   If not, **pause** (one retry max) and ask the user.
5. Commit per fix using:
   ```
   fix(qa): <issue title>

   Fixes issue N from .mstack/qa/<run>/report.md

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```
   Never `--no-verify`. Never amend.
6. Update `report.md` with the fix status (✓ fixed · ⏸ paused · ⊘ deferred).

## Final summary

After fixes (or after a report-only exit), tell the user:

```
QA run complete: <path-to-report.md>
Fixed: N · Paused: N · Deferred: N · Report-only: N
Recommended next step: <if anything paused/deferred> | <if all clean: "ship">
```

**Escalation hook — un-RCA'd issues → /mlabs-debug.** If any issue ended
`⏸ paused` or `⊘ deferred` *because root cause wasn't obvious* (not because
the user chose to defer), the "Recommended next step" line MUST suggest:

```
/mlabs-debug --from-qa <YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>
```

This is a *suggestion*, not an auto-spawn — the user invokes it. `/mlabs-debug`
will read the issue from this run's `report.md` and do a focused RCA.

Append a learning if anything non-obvious surfaced (e.g. a flaky selector,
a hidden auth requirement). Use `append-learning.sh`.

## report.md scaffold

```markdown
# QA report — <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>

**Env:** <localhost:3000 | staging URL>

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't fix without approval.** The gate is non-negotiable. The report has
  to land first.
- **Don't write specs into `e2e/`.** Use the temporary spec dir under the QA
  run; `e2e/` is for the project's permanent suite.
- **Don't loop on flaky tests.** If a scenario fails inconsistently, mark it
  flaky in the report and ask the user — don't keep retrying.
- **Don't fix beyond the approved scope.** If you spot a bug while fixing
  another, add it to the report and ask, don't sneak it in.
- **Don't bypass hooks.** Same rules as `/mlabs-code`.
